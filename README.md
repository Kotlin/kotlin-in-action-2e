# Code samples for Kotlin in Action, Second Edition [![JetBrains team project](https://jb.gg/badges/team-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub) 

This project contains the code samples from book "[Kotlin in Action, Second Edition](http://kotl.in/in-action)"
by [Sebastian Aigner](https://twitter.com/sebi_io), [Roman Elizarov](https://twitter.com/relizarov), [Svetlana Isakova](https://twitter.com/sveta_isakova),
and [Dmitry Jemerov](https://twitter.com/intelliyole).
To build the project, import it as Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA.

Each of the samples is a self-contained file, and most of them contain a "main"
function. To run a sample, simply open the file in the IDE, right-click the
"main" function and select the "Run" or "Debug" option from the context menu.

Some of the samples do not contain a "main" function, and are provided only as
a reference or demonstration of a concept. You can simply study them, or you
can incorporate them into your own examples or exercises.

The numbering of the sample files corresponds to the order in which they
appear in the book, but not necessary the specific listing numbers (since we also include some of the unnumbered code
snippets here).
